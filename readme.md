# VersionX 3 #

_If you're looking for the current stable version of VersionX, see the [v2 branch](https://github.com/modmore/VersionX/tree/master)._

VersionX is a versioning system for the MODX content management system. It keeps track of changes to your resources, templates, template variables, chunks, snippets, plugins, and _now in v3 custom objects too!_ You can view historic changes and revert changes from a simple dashboard.

v3.0 is a complete rewrite and is not compatible with v2. 
There is, however, a migration utility included that will assist with moving your old data to the new tables.

## The Road to v3.0 ##
Version 3 would not have been possible if not for the impressive community funding. _[More on this soon...]_

## Requirements ##

- MODX 2.6.5+ 
- PHP 7.4+

VersionX can be installed from either the [modmore package provider](https://modmore.com/about/package-provider/), or the [MODX package provider](https://extras.modx.com/package/versionx?version=2.4.0-pl).
